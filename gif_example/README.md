# gif example

Example for writing a Processing sketch that exports an animated gif. This
originally [appeared in my
tumblr](//jordanorelli.com/post/43535803050/one) back in 2013 and
depends on the
[extrapixel/gif-animation](//github.com/extrapixel/gif-animation/tree/3.0)
library, a copy of which is included in the libraries folder of my sketches
repo.
